On my third day on the job I went to find a hotdog stand and was successful. However, it was just a plain jane hot dog with a little ketchup and mustard. Good but not really anything to look forward to again.\n\nFast forward a few weeks. I am walking the streets of Tryon looking for something to inspire my palette because I'm in one of those rare moods where I just can't decide what I'm hankering for.\n\nI came across the Chili Man stand on Tryon between 4th and Trade and saw a few people ordering and being chatted up by the owner. Loving verbal engagement I wandered over and stood in line meanwhile listening to a random story being recounted by the Chili Man himself.\nThere are essentially two main options on the menu: Hotdogs and Brats.\nFortunately I happen to like both and ordered one of each.\n\nThen I got to pick my toppings for my meal. For my brat I just got brown mustard and Sauerkraut (major kudos for even offering a brat with kraut, which is surprisingly rare). I took my dog based on his recommendation which included spicy mustard, spicy ketchup, chili and cheese.\n\nI will say both were great but the chili just put things over the edge. It did not seem like a generic canned chili and I have been told (though not confirmed) that he makes it himself. It would not surprise me. It does not matter if you don't have cash because he is up on the digital age and can accept credit cards.\n\nSo the food is fantastic but one thing that makes you want to come back and what puts this place at the top of my Uptown lunch list (besides the chili) is Vic \"the Chili Man\" himself. I do not think this man has ever met a stranger. He always has a great story or conversation topic that has nothing to do with the weather, sports or politics. It is refreshing to say the least. If you are ever in a downcast mood, this man can lift your spirits with a good conversation or story. He is not intentional about it, it is just who he is.\n\nCome for the dogs, hang around the cart for the conversation. Be prepared to repeat.","useful":10,"user_id":"Ntq_6n5SpkZGmNHXnEmlNQ"}

Cheese, chili, Chili Man's designer taco sauce, homemade spicy mustard, jalapenos and onion. HOLY. Like, holy should be in 72 pt font. I also got a dog with kraut and homemade spicy mustard.

He's an entertaining guy as others have said, genuinely cares about his customers, and he always provides awesome dogs with great service. \nMy favorite part is the dogs come exactly as you like. While there is a list of the famous \"named\" dogs, you can change or add unlimited toppings to them for no extra charge, and he'll make things exactly as you like. Want a TON of spicy mustard? No problem. Just a little BBQ sauce? Same deal. He even asked me if I wanted the BBQ sauce on my \"Q Dog\" to be spicy, sweet, or fruity and how much. \nThe hot dogs and buns are solid quality, but what sets the Chili Man apart are his toppings. The chili is really beefy, flavorful, fresh, and clearly not from a can. The spicy mustard is awesome, the slaw is vinegary but just slightly sweet, the taco sauce is good..I could go on and on about every topping, but the point is they're great. If your dog has \"fried cheese\" he even puts a little cheddar cheese directly on the griddle to crisp up before adding it to the dog which is perfect. \nGo to the Chili Man, order a few hot dogs depending on how hungry you are (I'm partial to the life changer with extra mustard if you like fairly spicy things), pay the cheap price, thank Vic, and enjoy your killer lunch.","useful":2,"user_id":"aLqp_fe64ugZFuwMpsXLiw"}

The typical jovial light fell from Vic's eyes as he stared down the errant patron. His throat uttered an inhuman growl, with the clearly discernible words \"I will cut you\" flowing forth from his lips.\n\nOh wait, that guy may have been me. It'd be really brave and edgy to give these chili dogs 4-stars to break the hot streak, but at the end of the day it'd be just incorrect. Regardless of threats of bodily harm (not serious in case you're wondering) the ratings are here for a reason.\n\nI won't repeat too much of what other people have said, but it's pretty crazy that Vic's been able to elevate tube meat to this level of an art form. However I will say some things that are important to note before you decide to try a dog:\n\n* There are non-spicy options that are sublime, but I do believe that in general the spicy options are your best bet.\n* Because of the large amount of ingredients and his mouth, if there's a line there will also be a wait. Expect about 4 minutes per person in front of you. I consider it worth it when there's  less than 6 people in front. Please don't be the guy who orders 10  dogs for the office. Get them to come with you outside.\n* This is a street dog. It's served from a grandfathered in open hot dog cart. Vic wears gloves most the time and uses hand sanitizer. If you're expecting clean-room food... first why are you getting a hot dog, and second this place isn't for you. HOWEVER let me be clear - I've probably eaten at least 50 hot dogs from here (oh god) and have never seen or experienced anything untoward in regards to food safety. Just an FYI.\n* If you want to know of specials, locations, and if Vic's even gonna be out on the street, you should check FB.","useful":1,"user_id":"cpkkojfuNh4zaXHvgDZoMw"}

My boyfriend has been raving about the Chili Man and his stand for months now. I was finally able to have him come down during his lunch break for some of these amazing hot dogs. \n\nThe Chili Man hot dog stand is parked right in front of Chima's steakhouse Tuesday-Friday from 11a-2p. There will be a line, but don't let it deter you. Not only are the dogs delicious but Vic is friendly and funny. Despite the fact that you'll be waddling away after chowin down and may need a food coma nap afterwards, the Chili Man experience is worth it. JUST DO IT, as I will tell you in the next paragraph, even vegans don't have an excuse. \n\nWhat really had me sold was Vic now has vegetarian friendly tofu dogs! Seriously most thoughtful hot dog vendor EVER! I walked over with my bf just expecting him to fulfill his craving, I wasn't going to get anything since the last uploaded menu on yelp only consisted of red meat hot dogs. But to my surprise I was able to have one too, I was so happy! AND the Chili Man even offers VEGAN Chili Wednesdays complete with vegan hot dogs and TVP chili. So rad. \n\nOk I'll stop raving now.. Lol so my boyfriend had the life changer and I had a vegetarian friendly life changer with a tofu dog and minus the chili. We didn't talk to each other while eating, hell, I don't even think we took a breath. That's how good the Chili Man dogs are. All in all, the Chili Man is THE man and his dogs are righteous. Goes without saying he will be seeing me every week..which brings me to my next quest...I need to find a good gym. \n\nCheers!","useful":9,"user_id":"C5QsUsQg5I3dMdLM02SXGA"}

Take my advice, don't get him started!\n\nThe Mac & Cheese & Chili & Bacon dog is a fine example. It's a huge fan favorite and only comes up as a special a few weeks in the season. How could you possibly add anything to this without it getting lost in the other flavors? How about looking at texture first, then backing that up with supreme taste: Parmesan and Garlic flavored Panko bread Crumbs to top it off. Do I have your attention now?\n\nLast week he was going Canadian with this awesome Beer Cheese and Potato Stix on top.

Definitely a great staple to add to your Uptown Charlotte experience.  \n\nEven after my dogs were secured in my belly, I was watching Vic interact with the customers and everyone definitely walks away with a smile and one hell of a chili dog.

All tolled, I was there for 6 hours: from an early yoga session masterfully led by Lisa Valle, who wove mind\/body\/spirit into the one hour and 15 minute practice, to a chocolate-peppermint body scrub, then an added-on facial (as I was happy to remain in the company and expert hands of Natalie, the asethetician), to lunch and the finaly service of the day - a pedicure that included extensive defolliation and leg\/foot massage. \n\nThe staff members I encountered were all professional and extremely courteous.  I felt welcome and pampered.  The services were simultaneously relaxing and invigorating.  Peaceful. \n\nThe facility is conveniently located on Scottsdale Rd. with ample parking by the entrance, which is behind the main thoroughfare making for easy access.  However, the interior looks ready for an rejuvination of its own - the painting and furnishings are dated, the towels worn and frayed.  Same for the small poolside area.  \n\nThere are many selections one can chose for lunch upon checking in. My choice was a salad, which was set out for me in the main dining\/lounging area after my tacked-on  facial request (I do have to commend the staff for being so accommodating) and was sent in a plastic container from a local, well-established take-out deli.  The fresh-baked cookie dessert was served to me warm on a plate during my pedicure, making for a nice touch to the otherwise standard fare. \n\nLiving in Scottsdale, I've had the pleasure and opportunity to sample many of the amazing spas in the local resorts.  The ambiance at such establishments certainly out-shines that of the Spa Lamar, but in terms of services provided I would definitely say they're on par, at a cost that is somewhat less than the finer establishments.","useful":1,"user_id":"3FyjK8S2nINLyf_3bjhyFQ"}

It can get a little crowded for the more popular classes, but it still feels welcoming.  The room is not kept in the usual air conditioned deep freeze (which I appreciate), so your muscles can remain warm and loose.  I don't really enjoy the extreme heat of Bikram, so this is a nice compromise.  I don't know how this will fair during the Phoenician summers, but for now I am enjoying.\nCheck it out!","useful":1,"user_id":"CbHXrH-CHM8egdKYAxqaPQ"}

Heidi Lamar is doing just that. The interior of the spa is nice and clean. It has a natural feel with all of the hardwood floors throughout the building. \n\nI was invited to start ridding myself of stress by doing a paraffin dip on my hands. That was heavenly and I felt my cares melting away slowly. I then was taken on a tour of the entire facility. The place is HUGE and very nice! I went back into the common area and was invited to have a chair massage... ahhhh this evening is getting better and better! After my massage, I had my gnarly brows waxed. It's amazing what a little hair removal can do for your face. I highly recommend getting your brows done here to guys and girls! The aesthetician that did my brows was not only good, but she was educational about my skin and brows. After all that, I sat down to get my makeup touched up. This is where I wasn't as pleased. Bless the guy's heart, the artist had NO clue on what colors to use on my skin. He was SO excited to do my makeup, so I let him just go to town! I looked like a really dark Barbie with really BRIGHT lipstick... can you say radioactive tangerine lips? If you want something done right... do it yourself. Ahh well, my makeup is a mystery to many artists. It wasn't his fault. He tried.\n\nIs it the Phoenician? No. It's an \"Everyday Spa\" that is comfortable and clean with super friendly and professional staff. I hope to visit Lamar Spa again, to spend the day and be pampered! For now...

She asked if there were any areas that needed more attention and what type of touch I preferred.  All in all - I was relaxed and slept wonderfully hat night. Marilyn was informative about  home relaxing techniques. She made me feel welcomed and  \" well taken care of\".  It's been 3 weeks and I am still speaking of the Experience.

(2009 was the first time I had my hair lightened.)  Parking lot was empty, but it was raining hard, so I wasn't surprised... Besides me, I think there may have been only one other client, back in the coffee\/tea room.  Again, not a big deal, since I don't like crowds.  After checking in for my appointment, I was invited to sit down in the waiting area.  I found the wait pleasant- the area was tidy and cozy, and the music peaceful.  If you like to rummage through books and magazines, or look at hair and body products (and whatever else you may find for sale at salons), you won't have to look very hard here!  You'll find something to keep your mind busy, but I like to take the time to de-stress.  The receptionist offered something to drink, which is always nice!\n\nAfter meeting up w\/ my hairstylist\/colorist, she showed me where to dress down to my comfort level and put on a robe.  Yes, it wasn't a plush robe, and it made me feel uncomfortable, as it wasn't very flattering, but no one was around to see me, anyway, so I didn't care :)  After finding my way back to my colorist, we discussed about the results I wanted to see and feel, and she then told me what procedures she would take me through and how long each phase would take.  I found her a good listener and felt comfortable that she knew what she was doing.  I'm not much for talking while at salons, and I sensed that she knew this, but when I would speak up and ask her questions, professionally and personally, she was open to talking, as well.   I found this refreshing, bec. I've met quite a few stylists throughout the years that act slighted or mad when I'd rather not talk...\n \nThe results were fantastic!  My stylist didn't lie- the products she used made my hair very shiny and silky to the touch (some things that were lost due to the color-stripping), and the fact that it took awhile (from a few hours to a few days!) for others to realize that I had colored my hair back to brunette (I had caramel, blonde, and red high- and low- lights) is testimony that the coloring looks natural!  (Actually, the color she gave me is the darkest I've ever had my hair- darker than my natural haircolor.)  Many people did comment on how much weight I've lost, which isn't fact, so I attribute all the compliments to my darker hair :)\n\nEasier to access than Tempe's Moodswings (free parking!) and none of the snobbery one can find at other salons.  Less expensive than comparative salons, too!!  Friendly and knowledgeable staff, comforting and welcoming ambience... Give Spa Lamar a try!\n\nBTW, every first Wednesday of the month, Spa Lamar holds \"Live at Lamar,\" a \"happy hour\" of sorts, from 6p to 9p there's live music, light apps (nothing fancy, just something from the grocery, I'm told), and perhaps cocktails.  MOST SIGNIFICANTLY, if you bring a friend who's never been to Spa Lamar, services are BUY ONE, GET ONE FREE!  That's right, you read correctly!  What are you doing this coming First Wednesday?

I think they were having an off day here (I hope so) it seemed only one of the three (or four I can't remember) bathrooms were not clean\/working. One was stopped up, one the top was off and sitting on the toilet seat, another lock was broken. \n-Quality of products - this may sound snobby, but I was expecting some either nicer products or more upscale packaging for the shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc. The products were store-bought and I think White Rain or Suave. Not that these are bad products, it's just at a spa, where you just paid the going rate for a massage, you'd think they'd try to present a more upscale perception. \n\nBut just to repeat, the massage was good and the facility has some nice things about it.","useful":5,"user_id":"hxp8KDdGrvEkjNC6LdMqXQ"}

The experience has been entirely positive and I would recommend that anyone who is interested in health, fitness, or martial arts to give the class a try.  Here's some general information about the classes and the type of training offered at this school.  I hope you find it helpful.\n \nThe Programs\nThe programs are split up into individual segments so that you can choose only those that you are interested in.  The segments are split between Chi Kung, Kung Fu Fitness, and Kung Fu Practical.  There's also a free or optional donation meditation class on Saturdays which include an open discussion on spirituality, with a focus on Chan Buddhism (Note: don't let this optional section scare you off, this school does not preach religion or require you to believe in any particular faith).  It's up to the individual to choose which segments they are interested in signing up for.  Each segment runs between 45min to an hr long and are open to individuals of all fitness levels.  The degree of difficulty will ultimately depend on how hard you push yourself.  Instructor Dao recommends taking Kung Fu Fitness on its own first before taking the combination Kung Fu Fit\/Practical classes which takes close to 2 hours.  I've personally found that individual with some fitness background can generally start with both classes while those with little experience will want to start with Kung Fu Fit first.  Chi Kung classes are typically scheduled right before Kung Fu classes, so if you decide to sign up for all three, be prepared for a 3 hour session.  \n\nThe Training\nThe style of training is rooted in developing foundational skills through repetition.  Forms may seem basic and simple at first, but students will find they are actually quite difficult, especially if you are looking to develop speed and power through the movement.  Here's a quick description of what some of the classes are like.\n\nChi Kung - Shaolin Ba Duan Jin is the form of Chi Kung taught by Instructor Dao.  Emphasis in the first year of classes has been on abdominal breathing, the eight basic movements along with the variations, and to build awareness and sensitivity to chi in the lower dantian (energy store).  Intermediate classes emphasize directing chi flow during the eight movements and further development of sensitivity to chi in the dantian, hands, feet, and throughout the body.\n\nKung Fu Fitness - Classes begin with Shaolin warm up drills which are meant to develop coordination, flexibility, strength, and speed.  Warm up drills are mostly aerobic and dynamic.  They are followed up with stretching routines, which I've found to greatly enhance flexibility in a very short period of time.  This training has resulted in me being the most flexible I've even been in my 30 yr life (and I've been into fitness and conditioning since high school).  After stretching, static stance training is done to build core and leg strength.  An emphasis is also put on sensing and utilizing chi to support one self as opposed to using muscle.  All these drills together take approximately 25 min to half an hour.  The remainder of the class focuses on the foundations of kicking and punching.  The last few minutes of class are typically finished off with push ups and sit ups.\n\nKung Fu Practical - Classes begin 5 minutes after Kung Fu Fitness and usually begin with more advanced movements which typically involves a stance based kicking or punching movement.  The remainder of the class focuses on either sparring and application drills or Kung Fu forms.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThis is my first experience with a martial arts school so I don't have a basis for comparison.  But I will say that I've thoroughly enjoyed myself in the past 10 months and that I would encourage anyone interested in trying Kung Fu or Chi Kung to try one of these classes.  Besides the obvious benefits of increased health and fitness, the atmosphere is great, the instructor is knowledgeable, and the training is fun.  You've got nothing to lose.","useful":10,"user_id":"xU02wVd4akbHrk8JiOdDYQ"}

Her professionalism was head and shoulders above the other therapists I hired that day and I kept her card for the future. \n\nLike many people, I carry my stress in my back and shoulders and I need a deep tissue massage to really dig in to those spots (no wimpy Swedish massages for me!). I first went in with terrible pain and got a 60 min massage. She did the best she could and recommended I come back for a 90 min the following week, my stress and pain were that severe. I did as suggested and the 90 min was exactly what my body needed. I've never looked back and always get the 90 min now. \n\nAli changed offices and now works out of her charming old duplex home in Cornelius, just down the street from OTPH and the elementary school. It's peaceful and relaxing from the moment you walk in. \n\nAli is outstanding at homing in on where the pain is stemming from. Sometimes she hits a spot on my back and I can feel it clear up to my ear. She knows the body and underlying muscles well and knows by feel where to press and alleviate the stress and tight muscles.  I have a high tolerance because my muscles are *that* tight and she's always equal to the challenge, I suspect she works extra hard to get out my deep-rooted kinks. \n\nI've never left there without feeling vastly better and vastly improved. I always promise myself that I'm going to make self care a priority and go once a month and I should but don't. We work hard and deserve to take care of ourselves. This is my favorite way to take care of me. I'm going to get into a routine with her because it's good for the body and good for the soul. \n\nAli is committed to healthy lifestyle and natural remedies and yoga and she's interesting and engaging to talk to. I'd probably be more apt to book more often if there was an online booking option so I could see her availability when the urge for a massage strikes me. However she's bookable via text and always quickly responsive. \n\nI've never looked for a groupon or deal from anyone else since beginning to use Ali...

It's almost scary especially when you speak to her over the phone... Lol. However when you meet her in person you will quickly learn and witness the fact that she just loves her job. She really puts you at ease when you walk in and her professional demeanor is top notch.\n\nThe day I visited I was seen by Dr. Moses Corbel. May wife recommended this locale because she knows I love Cutting edge technology. Moses and his staff don't disappoint in this area as all the scans he performed were very accurate and matched my actual pain points I have experienced over the last year. The most shocking thing about this office was the fact they had an actual X-RAY Machine on-site. Why is that shocking you ask?

I was last minute with my decision in joining my friends (and some coworkers) for the festivities. Ticket was $30, which includes all you can taste beer for almost 4 hours. Frankly that's the main reason I caved in. The other event option of that day is the Beer, Bourbon & BBQ at South Park for about the same admission. Since I never have good experience with events at South Park location, Rural Hill I went.\nFirst of all the location is cool. I know there were other events hosted at Rural Hill, but this was my first time being here.  It's about 30 minutes away from home, but it felt like a world away. Plenty of free parking, good start. I parked closer to the festival, but there was another entrance for the camping crowd. \nThere were about 18 breweries listed on the event website, and quite frankly I didn't count. Let's just say there were plenty of choices. I went for the short lines, which tends to be breweries from other places. I don't understand why would anyone line up for the breweries based in Charlotte... hmm... I can just drive to them and drink. \nI had an awesome Tripel Belgium Ale called Devils Tramping Ground from Aviator Brewing Company. I was quite impressed by the NC breweries showing. There was also a home-brew tent, and I tried some interesting things there too (including a ginger cider, a toffee stout or was it a porter).\nThis was also a music festival, but unfortunately I was too consumed by the brew part and my friends ended up chilling by the campfire and I totally missed the bands... which is a small regret on my end. \nThere definitely will be a next time!","useful":0,"user_id":"M4yYtAXehUzaHB1ghl6EXg"}

I'm finding they're taking a much more proactive approach to customer service, instead of giving you the run around they're much quicker and better at addressing customer concerns. The GM personally makes phone calls to address issues and the clubs owner is on hand every morning \n\n3. Investment in personal training. I purchased a block of training a while back with Jahmal R. He's a great trainer and is involved with my training and goals and not just being on his phone like many of my previous trainers. \n\nThis should show that any business can do better and deserves a second chance.

On one hand, their service was efficient, professional, and careful. But on the other hand, their pricing seemed a little shady. \n\nFirst off, the two movers that they sent were friendly and helpful. They were very accommodating and were very efficient. I would definitely recommend them for service. Although they were late, they did notify me of this before hand, so that's a \"plus\" in my book. They handled my stuff gently and took care when I separated out my fragile items.\n\nThe only issue I had with them (a rather large one, as you can probably tell) was the pricing. Their quote for a simple move was great compared to other movers and they stated that they billed per-hour. However, once they got there and noticed that there were more boxes than they imagined, one of them pulled me aside and told me they were going to be billing me more than their original quote by around 3x. This was the shady part because he had me walk with him to a private area to tell me this. Sure, unexpected costs are a reality, but I had already stated approximately how much stuff I had, was able to pack everything into their truck in one go, and was within the timeframe for the original quote. So 3x the original price seemed very excessive. Because of this, the move ended up being much more than other options we had and was rather unexpected. \n\nWould I recommend them again? Yes, for their service. However, just be extra careful when you're explaining your move with them to make sure you get an accurate quote or else you might be just as surprised as I was.","useful":2,"user_id":"bp7Ut44CCWlnEgYzfK3jdw"}

I used to go to this business a long time ago when it was called Grace's Grille. It doesn't seem like a lot has changed since then (It doesn't appear to look any different on the outside or inside, the food is very similar, and the clientele may even be the same).\n\nTony's Family Restaurant is your typical diner, chock-full of dinner specials, early bird deals, and outdated decor. Unlike many older diners, Tony's is a clean place, there aren't a ton of cracked seats or dust lingering in the air. Also, the dining area is very small, so you'll be packed in pretty tightly.\n\nService was good, we were greeted by friendly faces and seated immediately. The waitresses seemed attentive to every table, including ours, and we placed our order after a few moments of looking over their small menu. I ordered a make-your-own burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, pepper jack cheese, and bacon.\n\nThe food took a while to get to our table, but not too long. Everything came out piping hot, almost to the point where you couldn't even pick it up. The vegetables on my burger seemed really fresh, and tasted really good. On the other hand, I had ordered my burger cooked medium, what I got was a well-done burger. I can stomach a well-done burger because that is what I grew up with, and I didn't want to cause a scene or wait for another one. It was alright, but I was hoping to be blown away by the burger with the visuals on the plate, it was very bright.\n\nMy girlfriend did enjoy her meal, she got one of their wraps. It was just as hot as my food, but she really enjoyed what she had. She also really liked their fries (I did too).\n\nAfter we ate, my girlfriend noticed their specials, and she would have gotten one of them if we had seen them earlier. We weren't made aware of any of their specials, so be prepared to look them over when you get into the door.\n\nAll in all, it was an okay experience. Great servers, quick service, and food that's on par. It's a cheap place to eat and I would say it's alright, if you don't mind eating around people that are 70+ years old. If you are 70+ years old, then this is your spot.\n\nI think I may return for breakfast in the future, and I may even give their dinner a second chance.","useful":1,"user_id":"v3z7hZNGkk7IlHasnSXYRA"}

The information for that special is a little confusing to understand, and it's not in very big writing, so there it is. Get it while you can. I got it. The fries are kinda like McDonald's fries, insofar as they're on the limp and mealy side. They're thicker cut though. The chicken is less mealy than KFC's, more crispy, and don't give off that nasty KFC aftertaste. The pieces are of decent size. However, it's not the crispiest fried chicken I've ever had and it's also not the tastiest. It's also slightly salty for my tastes. I've had better chicken for cheaper, so I don't think I'll be intentionally making a stop here, but if I'm in the area and I'm craving chicken, I might come again.

However I had always heard good things about Mimi so after cardio training\/hill running at the Riverdale Park, about 6 other team members and myself decided to give the pho at Mimi's a try.  One thing to mention - if you have never ordered a fresh fruit smoothie to enjoy with your Pho, you are missing out.  \n\nService - we came at around lunch hour on a Sunday and the restaurant was about half full 30 mins after we arrived.  We had the most people in our group with 7.  2 people were working as servers, one was probably the owner.  Food took significantly longer than the expected (for a pho restaurant) to come out.  We had to remind them about our smoothies, which came almost after we were finished eating.  There was probably a 30 minute delay in between the first smoothie and the last smoothie (ordered 7)\n\nSmoothie - the mango smoothie was tasty, however it tasted like it was made from mango nectar rather than the actual fruit.  My team member had the avocado and said it was good.  Another team member ordered the jackfruit and said it was terrible with no flavour.  I had the sour sop and it was alright - it would have better if the flavour was stronger.\n\nSizes - Sizes at pho restaurants are a hit and miss. Sometime you get a gigantic bowl for a large and sometimes you get a bowl the size of a small.  At Mi Mi's, there is hardly a noticeable difference between the small and the large.  Many of our guys were shocked when the bowls came out.  In short, bowls are small - order a larger size.  \n\nPho - I tasted the rare beef and beef balls noodle.  The broth was very clean and tasty - not as oily as the soup at Train.  Noodles were fresh.  Tasted like what pho should taste like.  \n\nVermicelli with grilled beef and spring rolls (bun) - nothing that stands out here.

If you go to MiMi's, I would strongly recommend their Vermecelli dishes.\n\nI also eat their rice dishes, they're good too.  And yes, there seem to be a lot of white people in this restaurant for some reason... but I think that's because it's a slightly nicer looking pho place and the waitress there is really friendly and speaks English fluently (as well as Chinese and Vietnamese) - which is impressive!","useful":2,"user_id":"mrru6hbeQLvagU4vkfuqmw"}

I would come back here for sure! \n\nAtmosphere - 3\/5\nTaste - 5\/5\nPortion -5\/5\nPrice - 6\/5\n\nAtmosphere - the sign our front is scribbled in italic cursive red on a while background. There are a few large plants from the window and you can tell this is an authentic Vietnamese food. As you walk in, you can see the restaurant is long and narrow with about 20 to 30 seats. There is not much use of aesthetics on the wall.\n\nTaste - I ordered a chicken and porkchop on rice dish with shrimp roll and avocado milkshake. The rice dish came with chicken broth soup as well and it was excellent. The porkchop was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth with a savoury finish. The chicken lacked taste as it was thicker so perhaps not as marinaded. The shrimp roll was ok and usually I look forward to the peanut sauce but this one did not taste like peanuts. The avocado shake was beautifully presented with two pieces of strawberry on the top. It was missing a bit of sugar but I also tend to have more of a sweet tooth so I think this would have tasted perfect to others. \n\nPortion - I definitely ordered with my eyes than my stomach. I was too full to finish all my food. I had a piece of the shrimp roll, some soup, and finished the porkchop but not the chicken so now I have lunch for tomorrow! \n\nPrice - $12.50 for the rice dish, $4 for the avocado shake and $4 for the shrimp rolls.

We were looking for a quote for our stairwell. We simply did not have the ability to paint those high areas safely on our own. \nSarah came to give us a quote. She took her time, made measurements, gave us a very professional quote and explained a few things we hadn't thought of. FreshCoat was not our first quote, and they were not our last, but they quickly became the only one we would consider to enter our home. Sarah brought up very important details. \nAre the contracted painters licensed, insured and bonded? We didn't realize that if someone fell, while painting, it could potentially be our liability! Sarah showed us proof of their licensure and insurance for each contracted employee. \nThe quote from FreshCoat wasn't the cheapest, but it also wasn't the most expensive. The principle of the matter was that they were the ones we felt we were most comfortable to be in our home with our three small children (all under the age of 5) running around. The time finally came for us to pull the trigger and book for our stairwell (it takes us a long time to decide on colors). Sarah was clear and precise with the work that needed to be done. We discussed colors, and I let her know the color we had chosen. Their quote included paint. \nSarah arrived first. She cleaned the baseboards (they were embarrassingly filthy), laid drop cloths, and began part of the taping process. She was professional, introduced herself to our children, and has such a wonderful personality that I enjoyed having her in our home. Danny arrived shortly thereafter. He came in, saw our backsplash (which was installed by our builder) and even recommended some finished we could find to make the backsplash pop and look more finished and polished. He quickly connected with the children and made us feel at ease. \nTheir contacted painters were phenomenal. They came in, introduced themselves and were friendly. The job didn't take longer than 4 hours, and our stairwell was complete. The color is gorgeous. They invited us to look at the project and find anywhere where we found issue. My husband and I saw a couple of spots, and they generously, and without attitude fixed them (as well as cleaned up a couple of spots from our homegrown paint job! but shhhh....don't tell!) \nI have a particular apprehension to the feel of builder's paint. It feels like chalk and it actually makes me nauseous to touch. Sarah assured me when we initially discussed it that she would select a paint that wouldn't have that same feel. She really came through. It feels like velvet, and that is very important to me. \nThank you, Sarah and Danny, for making this a seamless and smooth process. We are very particular about who we let into our home when our babies are here, and you made us feel comfortable. The paint job is beautiful. The lines are crisp and clean, the walls are smooth, and there are no flaws. We are both impressed and grateful!","useful":0,"user_id":"29mxHhUOaTYrlymWKAyUNg"}

It was enormous that she had difficulty to finish it completely. I ordered the drink, perro salado (tequila based) and vegetarian flautas. My drink was mind blowing. My flautas was good, but it could have been better; slight zing was missing. Then we asked for churros on the menu, but they only serve churros on the weekend. That was saddening.\n\nInitially, it wasn't busy, later on more customers came in, so the music became louder. It killed the vibe. Second server who took over, was little abrasive, so it was disappointing.","useful":4,"user_id":"yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g"}

The renovations didn't touch the original exterior arch, or the balconies and moldings inside, so it feels completely ghostly and the sound is warm, resonant and lovely as only old spaces seem to be. The gentle rake on the floor, and a second level with lots of room for bar, coat check, merch, means that even if they don't open the balconies visibility is great and there's a feeling of comfort and movement. The lighting inside is beautiful and not garish (can't say the same for the flashy Virgin logo on the new sign outside, but if they are paying for it's survival I guess I can forgive them the vanity plate.) \n\nAlso - 4$ Rolling Rock. That has to be the best beer option and price point at any venue of this size in the city. Speaking of size, total capacity is about 800. ~500 if you just use the floor.

One of them was the TTS manufactured top frame and custom vinyl fabric roof combination. The top assembly arrived quite quickly and I was very pleased with both the quality of items and the relative ease with which everything fitted in place. The excellent geometrics of the frame were such that the fabric roof fitted perfectly, without any cracks, gaps and\/or open areas around the edges. More recently I ordered the front end lower skid plate that fits under the front end to protect the car from off-road objects and encountered a perplexing difficulty receiving the item. After waiting quite a while, I checked my order on-line to find out that the order was inexplicably 'on hold', with no further details available. A call to TTS resulted in an explanation that the part was currently out of stock (but with replacements coming soon). Apparently no one had bothered to contact me about this, which was a bit irritating. HOWEVER, things were soon straightened out and after a bit of delay the part finally arrived. The part itself was great, well made and up to the usual TTS standards of high quality, but somehow or other the installation instructions had not been included in the package, which resulted in a bit more delay & confusion. Long story short, TTS is a great place to find important and hard-to-find replacements parts for your VW Thing, but patience is sometimes required when a glitch occurs. They are very busy some times and available manpower may make it a bit difficult to complete things in a timely manner. This should not serve to discourage others from patronising TTS. They are great people who really care a lot about our Type 181 'Thing' VWs. Thanks, folks!","useful":2,"user_id":"LKwoGtQ7EAr5MAXClik4-Q"}

The location is convenient and the charm is all there, especially since this house-turned-bar is nestled in among the quiet residential streets of Avalon. \nThe bartenders have quickly learned our name and are quite hospitable. The same goes for the chef, who is not only talented but seems caring about quality and pleasing the customer.

Also found out the most of the prices on the menu went up so they really need to update there menu so people who are new to ordering from a place like me will know and there regular customers will know also they told me it would be a 15 dollar delivery charge with my order which I think was ridiculous and highway robbery but companies will find away to get more money out of you one way or another. Now onto the food the driver delivers my food I pay him expect the change back and he's not sure what to give me back I think he knew just didn't want to come out of his pocket to give me the exact change but whatever I get my food pizza is really delicious probably not as good as some of the mom and pop pizza places I went to but for the quality you get it's good. The chicken wings were good a few wings were overcooked more then others but it was still good would love to try there fries but I might order them the next time I order from here overall with some of the positives and negatives I mentioned this place is not that bad and it might be better then some of the other different pizza places that I didn't have much of a good experience if they didn't charge as much as they did for the delivery charge this place and if some of the wings weren't overcooked and the other problem I mentioned with the delivery driver this place would easily get 5 stars from me but overall I see myself checking this place out again when I get a chance.","useful":0,"user_id":"Unhr6Ut9xQowzzohevNdxg"}

The waitress who helped us throughout the night--and I say this as a person who dines out almost every day--has to be the most accommodating and personable server I've ever encountered. From the moment we sat down, she was on hand to answer every possible question. She clearly knew the menu well, and--unlike a lot of other places--was more than willing to give her honest opinion on who should be trying what.\n\nThe restaurant offers authentic Sichuanese and Cantonese food; I didn't order any of the authentic dishes because, per the waitress's recommendation, they're best eaten family style (and my friends, alas, did not prove receptive to the idea). Instead, I opted for the hot and sour soup (good, but not the best I've had--I would have liked it a bit more sour), the octopus nigiri (fine, but my least favorite order from the night), and the eel nigiri (excellent, with wonderful flavor and texture). I ordered the orange chicken as my entree. At first, I wasn't crazy about it, but it rapidly grew on me.\n\nAll in all, I can say that this has to be the best easy sit-down Chinese place of eaten at in the Charlotte area. It avoids the greasiness a lot of other places seem to embrace while delivering hearty flavors and the service is truly exceptional, and I cannot wait to return (with better company) to sample some authentic dishes.","useful":2,"user_id":"C9SXbEJRPhThD5CSTXGalA"}

Expecting to wait a little bit even on weekday evening, we were surprised that no wait at all.  Actually only 3 or 4 tables were occupied.  Nonetheless we were happy not having to wait.  We studied the two sets of menu, Cantonese and Sichuan (no sushi on Tuesday) and settled on 3 dishes, all fairly authentic Chinese.  The waitress was very helpful and friendly.  \nThe duck dish came first since it is a cold (room temperature) dish.  Duck was brined in salt and spice liquid then steamed and let cool down before serving.  Portion is good, so is the flavor.  Second dish was a spicy dish with battered and fried fish fillet pan fried with cilantro and red hot chili pepper in just a little bit of oil.  Fish is fresh and flaky but the batter is a little chewy.  We have had better, but it still gets a passing grade from us.  The last dish was deep fried tofu with saut\u00c3\u00a9ed vegetables.  The dish had to be prepared only upon ordering so it took the longest, we were told.  Tofu was a little crispy on the outside and hot and soft on the inside; exactly the way it should be.  The vegetables were not overcooked and still had some crunchiness.  The sauce was also pretty good which gives flavor to the tofu.  We were pleasantly surprised at the end, not so much by the quality, or selection, of the dishes, but by the fact  restaurants such as this serving fairly authentic Chinese food actually exist and even thrive around Charlotte.  We were also told that the restaurant has not 1 or 2, but 4 chefs, including a Japanese sushi chef.  It is difficult to fathom how busy the place has to be on the weekend to support the large staff.

They were packed. Around 13 tables inside, and a sushi bar. The sushi bar chef is actually Japanese, and his wife works as a waitress. On a any given day they have 4 waitresses, but last night, they were so busy I think I saw 5 or 6. There are 13 tables inside the restaurant. spacious and clean bathrooms. \n\nOrdered off their Chinese menu (At the back of the regular menu):\n1. Egg noodle stir fried with soy sauce $9.50. Pretty big portion. Nothing too spectacular but definitely tasty, sesame, onion stir fried egg noodle in soy sauce. \n2. seafood tofu clay pot $16. Very good, but SUPER salty! I did not have enough rice to finish this dish because the salt content was so heavy. The seafood was generous portion and the tofu is not the fresh type but the tofu puff type, which I like. Great sauce, but again, too salty.\nAll the waitresses here work together, you will not have the same waitress who took your order to bring out your food. A different waitress brought out our food and she mistakenly took our sea food clay pot to the table next to ours. She of course sincerely apologized, but I thought the logistics could have been worked out better.\n3. Chinese broccoli in garlic sauce $10. This I thought was kind of overpriced, I mean I guess so is the seafood tofu clay pot if you were really getting down to the nitty gritty. The Chinese broccoli were cut up to smaller pieces so it's easier to eat, it was very tasty, but there weren't that much on the plate. Any non-noodle dishes that are not appetizers come with 1 small cup of rice, you get a choice of 1. egg fried rice, 2. white rice or 3. brown rice.\n\nService was very friendly and perky, definitely way superior than typical Chinese or Asian joints. Nothing sketchy here. They don't try to scam you, or do things that make you question why they did certain things. The whole experience was very comfortable. Lighting was great, seats were nice and so is the dining table. Overall nice ambiance. \n\nI don't know many restaurants in Charlotte where you can order such authentic Chinese dishes, oh I was told the head chef here is from HK. However, this is the only authentic Chinese cuisine in Charlotte area I am able to locate that actually has good service and great ambiance.","useful":0,"user_id":"8zpZLEWweD0Tp6wLTzlZsQ"}

I've only been in here for lunch but wouldn't be opposed to coming by for dinner some time. There's something different about this Chinese place compared to so, so many others camped out in Food Lion shopping centers throughout the South.\n\nSo many of those other places often feel so gimmicky. Cheap meals with a front of being authentic Chinese. While I've only had the lunches here so far (which fit firmly into the \"standard American Chinese food\" category) I get the feeling that they're legit here. They're not actually strictly staffed by Chinese people. Oddly enough, that's indicator number one that they might be authentic.\n\nAnyways, staff here has always been super nice and helpful. Easily among the friendliest staff I've met at a Chinese restaurant. They actually take time to talk to you and get to know you. They sport mini iPads for taking orders and I'm sure that enables them to get to tables quickly without having to run orders back to the kitchen constantly. I've never met with a delay on receiving my food here.\n\nThe food flavor and quality isn't anything to write home about. Again, basing this entirely on the lunch menu right now. I'd really like to take a shot at some more authentic stuff. I've had the sesame chicken and it's honestly a bit plain. But this won't stop me from going back in again for lunch.

There are just more Cantonese people up there so the options are endless but after eating at Lee Cafe I will no longer need to wait until my trips up north to get good Cantonese\/Szechuan style dinner. \n\nMy suggestion is to go in a larger group so you can order entrees and do it family style. If you have never had Szechuan before, Most dishes come out with a ton of Szechuan peppercorn but they are thicker and harder to chew so if you don't want it spicy they are easily avoidable.\n\nWhen we sat down, we got a ton of menus. We got a sushi menu, a Chinese menu, and a regular menu. I strongly think you should go out of your comfort food when you try this place. There are not a lot of places in the area that have authentic dishes. So if you see a dish that you could get in a food court in the mall, try something else! Not because it wouldn't be good at Lee Cafe but because your taste buds will be in for a treat! \n\nThe Szechuan Wonton\n(Which was pork and had pieces of whole shrimp, not minced) were delightful. The best part was the sauce the wontons were in. Super flavorful!!! We loved it so much in fact after we finished the wontons we saved the plate of sauce to pour over our white rice. \n\nDry-fried Green Beans \nHands down! The best garlic green beans I have ever had. I don't know what dry fried means but the green beans were bright and plump and had a crisp bite to them but were not oily. They came out with a ton of garlic and everyone at the tables loved them!!\n\nWe also got the Beef Chow Fun which is a guilty pleasure for me, I personally always love any kind of fat noodle so it's really hard for me to review this because I'm biased. But guys at the table after the fact said we should have opted for a more traditional dish.  We also got the Spicy Chili Chicken which is also dry fried. It was a little tough for me but still tasted good. \n\nSo long story short, I will be coming back.

There are a few meat options, each with a few options of cheese and add-ons.\n\nYou are looking at around $9.00 for a sandwich, which isn't cheap.\n\nWhen you order, the guy rolls out a piece of dough and puts it on a griddle kind of like a crepe.  He then slices the meat or cheese and throws it on.  He then folds it and cuts it.\n\nI got mortadella and arugula and a can of soda for $10.00. No tomato no condiments nothing.  \n\nIt was very tasty!  I enjoyed it and appreciate the freshness.\n\nI noticed they coffees are very well priced so for an espresso drink the value here looks great.\n\nI don't know if I will go back soon because I found it a bit expensive for the ingredients.  But I will probably go back eventually.","useful":0,"user_id":"FQo8HxOxlhMgDQod9NwfHQ"}

Dehors, une ardoise avec le sp\u00c3\u00a9cial du jour. A l'int\u00c3\u00a9rieur, 2 comptoirs avec 3 bancs et la cuisine. Disons que le prendre pour emporter serait plus pratique, ce que j'ai fait. L'artisan Piadineria porte bien son nom puisque tout est fait maison, m\u00c3\u00aame le pain de style ' pita ' qu'Il fait sur demande. Tu choisis ensuite la viande de ton choix ( mortadelle, prosciutto, jambon, etc. ), du fromage (mozarella, bocconccini, etc.) et les l\u00c3\u00a9gumes. Le prix est vraiment pas donn\u00c3\u00a9 : 10,00$ environ pour un simple sandwich. J'ai pris prosciutto et pesto, sans fromage.\n\nC'est super bon, mais ce n'est pas pour les petits porte-feuilles.","useful":3,"user_id":"pEzb9RfmnD2zn5wUPpdmzg"}
